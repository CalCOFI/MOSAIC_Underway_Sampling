## BACKGROUND

### Summary

This protocol describes the sampling of marine eDNA from the underway pump of a moving or stationary research vessel. This protocol was used on CalCOFI cruises, but could be adapted for use on any research vessel with an underway pump. The end result of this protocol is filters with preserved eDNA from surface seawater along the research vessel's path.

### Method description and rationale

This protocol describes sampling eDNA from the underway pump of a research vessel. A filter in a Swinnex housing is attached to the vessel's underway pump using tube adapters, and surface seawater underneath the vessel is pumped through the filter by the ship's underway system. After a certain distance and time decided by the goals of the specific sampling effort, the filter is taken out of the housing in a PCR hood, preserved in buffer, and stored in a freezer. This protocol could be adapted for use on any research vessel with an underway pump.

### Spatial coverage and environment(s) of relevance

This protocol can be used on any oceanographic research vessel with an underway pump that delivers surface seawater to the lab.

## PERSONNEL REQUIRED

One person with pipetting experience. Research vessel experience is recommended but not required. Two people can sample 24/7.

### Safety

There are no major safety concerns with this protocol. Proper PPE should be worn at all times, especially when sterilizing equipment with bleach.

### Training requirements

Standard molecular biology training including sterile technique and pipetting technique is required to properly conduct this protocol. Research vessel experience is recommended. In-person training in this method prior to the cruise is recommended.

### Time needed to execute the procedure

The process of setting up, starting, and finishing a sample should take around 60 minutes. The time to actually sample is determined by the goals of the study, since the samples are left running. Samples must be checked on approximately every 20 minutes during the sampling.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

### Notes
- You will be sampling during the day in parallel with deck observers. Collaborate as much as possible with the observers so you can keep track of mammal sightings.
- Each day, one or more transects will be sampled. Each transect starts and ends at a station.
- The underway system pulls water directly from the surface of the ocean (~5m deep). It operates consistently, but you can control the outflow through the tap at your work station. You should aim to run the tap and filter water from the beginning to the end of a transect. When on station, you can keep the tap running even when not sampling, unless told otherwise by the ship’s crew.
- The transect and station information will be written on the white board in the main lab; check this board at the beginning of each transect and consult with a CalCOFI technician if you have questions. Use the information to fill in the sample sheet. Please convert the lat-long from degree minutes to decimal degrees!

### Time Management
- Setup at the beginning of a shift:
  - Use DNAway to wipe down the hood, pipette, DNA/RNA Shield bottle, and anything else you touch a lot (See Step 2 below)
  - Swap out the shop towel
- Before each station (30-60 mins before):
  - Check the protocol and any plans you have for replicates so you know what you're doing on station
  - Make sure you've bleached enough equipment to use on station: Enough housings for the samples you'll start, forceps
  - Keep an eye on the ship's speed! Depending on the ship, starting and stopping could be very smooth and tough to notice.
- On station:
  - Check your latitude and longitude, take a picture or write it down
  - Stop the underway filtering, begin an on-station filter (see full protocol below)
- Leaving station:
  - Check latitude and longitude, take a picture or write it down
  - Stop the on-station filtering, begin transect filters (check: will you be doing two filters?) (see full protocol below)
  - After 1-2 hours (depending on the transect and your plans for the cruise), end the partial transect filter, and start a new one if that's the plan (see full protocol below)
- During spare time:
  - Sterilize housings and forceps
  - Check on filtration - is it still running?
  - If the waste carboys have more than 4 liters of water in them, record the volume and pour them out (see protocol below and video)
  - Data entry (try to do at least once per day)
  - Check with marine mammal observers, note sightings and audio detections
- End of shift:
  - If working alone, make a note of any issues, clean up and secure station.
  - If working shifts, pass on any information about equipment issues and current samples running.

### Sampling Protocol

#### Setup

1. Set up the hood for your clean work space. This is where you will assemble the new filters + housings, and transfer the filters from the housings to the cryovials.
2. Decontaminate the inside the hood thoroughly using DNAway or bleach. Spray the solution, let sit for 10 minutes, and wipe down.
3. Wipe down your forceps, cleaning solutions, P1000 pipet and tips, DNA/RNA Shield bottle, Sharpies and anything else you will use consistently in the hood before storing them inside.
4. After the hood has been decontaminated, keep it closed at all times unless working in it.

#### Underway water filtration

Filtration may be full transect or partial transect. The only difference is in Step 9.

1. After the ship begins transiting, turn on the underway outflow tap. Allow the water to run for 5 minutes to flush out any residual material in the line. You can run the line while you process your filter and set up the new one.
2. Turn off the tap and attach the pump tubing to the tap outflow.
3. Turn the tap on very low pressure, and press the end of the pump tubing against the bottom of the Swinnex housing to flow water through it backwards. This prevents bubbles.
4. Attach the Swinnex housing + filter to the adapter at the end of the tubing with the tap on low pressure.
5. Turn on the tap and adjust the outflow. Mark the start time.
6. Place the tubing outflow end in a marked carboy or graduated cylinder so you can collect the outflow.
7. When there are around 4 liters in the marked carboy, it is heavy and this is a good time to pour it out. Write the volume, place the tubing outflow in a graduated cylinder, pour out the carboy, and place the tubing outflow back in the carboy while pouring any water that was filtered into the graduated cylinder into the carboy.
8. When you reach the end of the transect (or decide to stop sampling for another reason) divert the tap outflow into the sink. It is acceptable to leave the tap flowing on station unless advised otherwise by the crew.
9. Filter until one of the following happens:
      - You notice the flow is slowing, indicating the filter is getting clogged
        - If the filter clogs near the end of a transect, there is no need to start a second filter. However, if it is less than halfway through the transect, attach a new filter to the line and continue filtration. Use a separate line in the sample sheet for each filter.
      - The transect is completed (you reach the last station).
      - The partial transect is completed (It has been 1 hour, 2 hours, or halfway through the transect depending on study goals).

10. Turn off the tap.
11. Measure the filtrate volume and mark the end time, and take a photo of or write down the latitude and longitude. This is very important!
12. In the PCR hood, set out your forceps decontamination kit: 4 x 50 mL Falcon tubes containing DNAway, water (x 2 tubes), and 100% EtOH, in that order.
13. Detach the Swinnex housing + filter from the tubing and bring them into the hood.
14. Label a cryovial with the cruise number and filter number.
15. In the hood, disassemble the Swinnex and transfer the filter into a labeled cryovial. Decontaminate your forceps by dipping them sequentially into the Falcon tubes before touching the filter. Label the tube - see below for the labeling scheme.
    - Roll the filter into a little tube or fold into eighths and stick into the vial. It is helpful to use two sets of forceps for this. See video protocol for one possible technique to do this with one pair of forceps.

#### Sample Preservation

1. Using a P1000 (1000 uL pipette), add 400 uL of DNA/RNA Shield preservative into the cryovial.
2. Place the cryovial in a -80ºC freezer as soon as possible.

#### Storage

1. Freeze at –80 °C in a box with other samples until extraction.

#### Post-Sampling/Sterilization

- You do not need to sterilize all tubing and filter housings in between every sample, but you should try to clean periodically.
- Clean both the tubing and the filter housing by attaching the empty housing (without a filter) to the tubing.
- Clean the filter housings by placing the tops in one bag and the bottoms in another, soaking in bleach 15 minutes, then rinsing and shaking three times with milliQ water in the bag.
- Wipe down the benches and other surfaces with 70% ethanol and/or DNAway.
- For every sample, allow the sample water to run through tubing for 5 minutes before adding a filter. This will flush any residual bleach and/or material from a previous sample.
- Do not allow bleach to go down the sink. Bleach can go in and out of its bottles and bags, and in the bleach waste carboy if it is dirty and you need to make new bleach.

#### Data records

- While filtering, record all the relevant information on the printed copy of the appropriate data sheet (underway vs CTD samples).
- Periodically (at least once per day) transcribe the written records into the electronic copy of the sample sheet.
- Full underway sample IDs should be as follows:
\<CRUISE-ID>_ \<LINENUMBER-TRANSECTNUMBER>_\<FILTER-NUMBER>
  - For example: RS2311\_LINE80-01\_F001
- Full CTD sample IDs should be labeled as follows:
\<CRUISE-ID>\_\<STATION>\_\<CTD-CAST>_\<FILTER-NUMBER>
  - For example: RS2311\_90-55\_C001_F002
- Cryovials can be labeled with the filter number only (F001 - FXXX)

### Quality control

**Negative Controls**
- To take a negative control, start with a filter in a housing. Turn on the ship's milliQ dispenser and press the back side of the housing to it, to make water flow backwards through the housing. Then, set the milliQ dispenser to dispense 2 liters of water and press the housing against it with the screw top facing the dispenser, so that water is flowing through the correct way. Once the 2 liters have flowed through the housing, take the housing to the sink where the underway samples are taken and rub the housing around the mouths of the outflow carboys used for underway samples. Put the housing in the PCR hood and process the filter as normal.

### Basic troubleshooting guide

**Filter clog**

If flow slows, first check the underway pump flow. If underway pump flow has slowed or stopped, ask the chief scientist what to do, and they will probably refer you to engineering. If a filter clogs and there's more than one hour left in the transect, end that and start a new one.

**Filters keep coming out torn**

If filters are torn when you open the filter housing to preserve them, try not tightening the housings quite as hard. Undertightening can lead to leaks, but overtightening can lead to filter tears.

**Filter housing is leaking**

Screw the housing together tighter. If the problem persists, try to screw it together straighter.
